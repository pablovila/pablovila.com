    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Pablo Vila</strong>, a full-stack web developer with
      over 8 years of experience in a wide range of skills, techniques and
      development. Currently, I'm working at{' '}
      <a href="https://www.cic.es/">CIC</a> as{' '}
      <strong>Senior Software Developer</strong>. I'm an enthusiastic developer,
      I love to learn new things and apply them in my work. I think, as a
      developer, we can never stop to learn and improve our skills. I like to
      build interactive and dynamic webs through clean code and solid
      architecture. I'm focused on fast and responsive web design.

      My journey began when I was a child, I was gifted with a computer and I
      couldn't stop to investigate and breaking it. I studied Systems
      Administrator course in my hometown. I learnt some basic programming
      principles there. I started to work immediately when I finished my
      studies, but I knew it wasn't enough, so I've been learning ever since.
      Then, I was more interested in mobile devices, so I attended an{' '}
      <a href="https://www.edx.org/es/course/android-introduccion-a-la-programacion">
        Android development
      </a>{' '}
      course by UPV. In two years, I changed from systems team to mobile
      development team. My first project was a GIS-oriented web with several
      tools for geoprocessing. Since then, I've done many projects, some as
      back-end developer, some as front-end developer and others as full-stack
      developer. In many of my professional projects, I've developed complete
      GIS, web maps or geoprocessing tools. Now, I'm attending to{' '}
      <a href="https://www.esri.es/cursos-y-master/experto-desarrollo/">
        GIS Development Expert
      </a>{' '}
      course by ESRI.
